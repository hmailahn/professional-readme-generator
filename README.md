# PROFESSIONAL README GENERATOR

## DESCRIPTION
Professional ReadMe Generator was made as a tool for developers to make a quick professional readme for any project in the command line. 

## USAGE
Developers can use this application to save time on making a professional readme. To use this professional readme generator, clone the repository code onto your own machine. In the terminal run 'node index.js'. This will run the application and you will be prompted with a series of questions about your project such as the title, description, installation, usage, credits, tests, license, and your contact info. This will generate a professional readme that includes a badge at the top for the project license, a functioning table of contents linked to each section, your input for each section, a link to more information about the license, and a link to your github and email.
